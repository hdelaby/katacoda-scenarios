Congratulations for your new position at Storedog! The legacy e-commerce application uses Ruby on Rails and Spree. 

There's a prebuilt Rails Docker container image, along with a few Python / Flask microservice which handle our Coupon codes and Ads which run on the store.

In this workshop, we're going to spin up and instrument our application to see where bottlenecks exist.

We'll focus on thinking through what observability might make sense in a real application, and see how setting up observability works in practice.

Before launching our web application, let's create our first RUM application in Datadog and set it up.
