As part of this workshop, your Storedog instance is unique and it is unlikely someone else is going to visit it. We will perform a few actions on the website to get some data to look at in RUM. Later on, you will see how Synthetic Tests can create a predictable traffic flow.

1. Visit https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-3000-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/

2. Go on a product page, add the product to the cart.

3. Go back to the home page. Click on another product and add the other product as well.

4. Click on checkout then go back to your cart.

5. Once on the cart page, remove the items from the cart and go back to the homepage.

Let's see what it looks like in Datadog.
