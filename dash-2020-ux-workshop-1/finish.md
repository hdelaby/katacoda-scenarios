# Move Fast Without Breaking Things
_Dash 2020 - UX Monitoring Workshops #2_

Congratulations, you just took a few steps towards safer deployments, and more stable infrastructures!

We hope you enjoyed this workshop, that it grew your interest for this subject and gave you the tools to dive deeper.

To summarize, and if you had to rememeber only a few things from this workshop, it would these:

- Things will break at scale, there is no avoiding it.
- To catch these regressions, we can use end-to-end tests (Synthetics) and monitoring (RUM).
- To catch them as early as possible, we can deploy carefully with the Canary strategy, and use CI/CD to trigger tests before publishing the changes.
