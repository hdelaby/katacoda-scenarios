# Speeding Up and Testing Web Applications
_Dash 2020 - UX Monitoring Workshop #1_

Congratulations, you just took a few steps towards a faster and more stable website!

We hope you enjoyed this workshop, that it grew your interest for this subject and gave you the tools to dive deeper.

To summarize, and if you had to rememeber only a few things from this workshop, it would these:

- Two main issues to avoid on your website: bugs and performance issues
- Two main ways to limit the impact on your customers: proactive testing and production monitoring from your users standpoint
- Various performance metrics will give you different insights on the performance of your web pages, and various strategies will allow you to improve them for your users
- Once your performance is optimized, you can create tests to ensure you will detect regressions happening to your website before your users do
- Prioritize your tests: features that impact your top line the most, or the highest number of users
