# Speeding Up and Testing Web Applications
_Dash 2020 - UX Monitoring Workshop #1_

Everything appears to be running smoothly with your web application, but then you begin seeing a few tickets rolling in from users about errors that you’re unable to replicate. A classic “it works on my machine” dilemma. Instead of digging around in your codebase, we can capture telemetry from an end user’s perspective to get a detailed view of the user journey. Utilizing this data we’ll create monitors and service-level objectives (SLOs) so we’ll be able to take the guesswork out of solving issues in the future.

This workshop is designed for attendees new to web performance observability. We will learn how to set up API and browser tests on key portions of an application, and define targets in order to meet business expectations. We will also set up real user monitoring (RUM), learn how to identify the most-visited portions of an application, surface user demographics, and prioritize where to invest to improve end-user performance.
